🛍️ Myntra E-Commerce Analytics Dashboard

Leveraging Analytics for Smarter Discounting & Customer Insights

📌 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end analytics dashboard for Myntra’s fashion e-commerce platform, built to demonstrate how data can be used to improve customer experience, pricing strategy, and business decision-making.

The dashboard focuses on identifying when discounts actually influence customer behavior and when they lead to diminishing returns, while also uncovering high-value customer segments.

The project was developed as part of MATRIX’25 – Leveraging Analytics for Myntra’s E-commerce Success.

🎯 Business Problem

In a highly competitive e-commerce environment, Myntra faces challenges such as:

Understanding customer browsing and purchase behavior

Reducing cart abandonment without eroding margins

Identifying high-value customer segments

Optimizing discount strategies beyond blanket promotions

This dashboard answers a critical question:

How can Myntra use analytics to reduce customer hesitation while protecting long-term profitability?

📊 Key Insights

Discounts show diminishing returns beyond ~15–18%
Deeper discounts do not significantly reduce abandonment risk but negatively impact margins.

Volume vs Value Segmentation

Customers aged 20–39 drive the highest transaction volume

Customers aged 46–56 generate higher net revenue per customer, indicating a premium segment

Behavioral Signals Matter
Browsing time acts as a strong proxy for identifying abandonment risk when traditional funnel data is unavailable.

📈 Dashboard Highlights

Clean, consulting-style KPI design

Discount impact analysis using behavioral proxies

Revenue analysis by age group, city, category, and payment method

Customer segmentation based on value and engagement

Actionable executive takeaway and forward-looking recommendations
